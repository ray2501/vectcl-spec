openSUSE vectcl RPM spec

[VecTcl](https://auriocus.github.io/VecTcl/) provides a numerical array
extension for Tcl with support for vectors, matrices and higher-rank
tensors of integers, floating point and complex numbers. It has builtin
support for basic array shaping, slicing and linear algebra subroutines
and is designed to integrate seamlessly with Tcl. The user interface
consists of a single command, `vexpr`, which acts as an expression
evaluator similar to `expr`.
